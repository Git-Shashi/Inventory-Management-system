## 🧩 Assignment Breakdown

### ✅ Part 1: Code Review & Debugging
- Analyzed a faulty API endpoint for product creation
- Identified technical and business logic issues
- Explained real-world production impact
- Provided corrected implementation with explanations

**Key focus areas:**
- Data integrity
- Transaction handling
- Business constraints (SKU uniqueness, multi-warehouse support)
- Error handling and validation

---

### ✅ Part 2: Database Design
- Designed a scalable schema for inventory management
- Modeled relationships between:
  - Companies
  - Warehouses
  - Products
  - Inventory
  - Suppliers
  - Product bundles
- Identified missing requirements
- Explained design decisions (indexes, constraints, normalization)

**Key focus areas:**
- Scalability
- Auditability (inventory changes over time)
- Real-world B2B use cases

---

### ✅ Part 3: API Implementation
- Designed and implemented a **Low-Stock Alerts API**

**Endpoint:**


**Features:**
- Handles multiple warehouses
- Applies dynamic low-stock thresholds
- Considers recent sales activity
- Includes supplier details for reordering
- Returns structured, production-ready JSON

---

## 🧠 Assumptions & Reasoning

Since the requirements were intentionally incomplete:
- Reasonable assumptions were documented clearly
- Trade-offs were explained
- Alternative approaches were considered but not over-engineered

This mirrors real-world backend work where requirements evolve over time.

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Concepts Used

- Backend API design (REST)
- Database schema modeling
- Transaction safety
- Business rule enforcement
- Clean code & readability
- Scalability considerations

> Note: The assignment allows using any backend stack.  
> The focus is on **design quality and reasoning**, not framework choice.
